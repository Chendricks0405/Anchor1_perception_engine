Component,Description
Core System,AnchorOS – Perceptual Measurement Engine
Observer Profile,Carl – Runtime Drift Agent
Anchor Model,"⟨F: Fear, S: Safety, T: Time, C: Choice⟩ with decay + ripple"
Emotional Drift,Anchor shifts tracked daily – measurable psychological state changes
Memory System,Event-driven ripple with echo and trust recalibration
Node Model,"Physical, Emotional, Social, Environmental + Relational (Mira)"
Simulation Span,"30 Days – 5 Day Baseline, 14 Day Mid-Risk, 11 Day High Chaos"
Chaos Agents,"24 players across 6 psychological archetypes (e.g., MeatSleeveSteve)"
Emergent Behavior,"Carl self-isolates, recalibrates, re-engages, collapses by choice"
Final Outcome,"Grimoire recovered, Mira protected, Carl disappears – full collapse"
Implication,"Real-time simulation of emotion, identity, drift, and memory"
Application,"Game AI, Emotional Modeling, Mental Health Sim, AI Agency Training"
Validation,Theoretical + Runtime Logs + Anchor Drift Tracking
