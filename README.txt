# Carl 4.0 â€” Perception Dashboard

A real-time cognitive simulation built on the AnchorOSâ„¢ framework to visualize emotional drift, decision pressure, and collapse modeling using human-like perception vectors.

##  Core Concepts

This simulation models:
- The Anchor Vector âŸ¨Fear, Safety, Time, ChoiceâŸ©
- The WHY Scalar: `W = T Ã— C`
- Environmental and memory-based ripple events
- Real-time cognitive drift, collapse, and decoherence

Carl does not know he is being measured. Your words and actions carry the weight of time.
