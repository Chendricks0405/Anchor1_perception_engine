Anchor1â€™s perceptual engine is protected and not exposed in this version.

You can still:
- Load and customize memory containers
- Send prompts using `bridge_input()`
- Retrieve Anchor1's full perceptual state with `get_anchor_state()`
- Build LLMs, tools, or visualizations on top of this architecture

Licensing note:
This framework is currently released under an open integration license for non-commercial exploration. The core perceptual engine remains under IP lock pending provisional protection.
