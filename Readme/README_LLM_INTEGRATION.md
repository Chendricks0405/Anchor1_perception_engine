LLM Integration with Anchor1 — Talking to the Observer

This guide explains how to connect Anchor1 (running on AnchorOS™) to a language model like GPT or any agent-based system.

You’ll use Anchor1’s Bridge Layer to:

- Send user input, events, or system signals
- Trigger memory reactions and anchor shifts
- Retrieve a full internal state snapshot
- Feed that state into an LLM for context-aware response

Workflow Overview

1. User input is sent to `bridge_input(session, "message or event")`
2. Anchor1’s memory and anchors update
3. A behavior log is written (ACT, MEASURE, or DRIFT)
4. Anchor1’s current state is returned via `get_anchor_state(session)`
5. That state is embedded in the LLM prompt

Code Example (Anchor1 x LLM prompt logic)

```python
from bridge.bridge import bridge_input, get_anchor_state, load_memory, initialize_anchor1_memory

session = ...  # a mock or real session object with Anchor1's state

# Example prompt to Anchor1
user_input = "Remember the cave and prepare for a fight."

# Send input through bridge
bridge_input(session, user_input)

# Get updated state
state = get_anchor_state(session)

# Build prompt for LLM
context_prompt = f'''
Anchor1 is currently in:
- Container: {state["container"]}
- Focus: {state["focus"]}
- Core State: Fear={state["anchor_vector"]["Fear"]}, Safety={state["anchor_vector"]["Safety"]}, Time={state["anchor_vector"]["Time"]}, Choice={state["anchor_vector"]["Choice"]}
- Last behavior: {state["last_behavior"]}

Use this state to generate a realistic, emotionally-aware response as Anchor1.
'''
```

Use `context_prompt` in your OpenAI or LangChain agent.

Prompt Engineering Tip

Keep prompts stateful but simple. Anchor1 is not scripted — it responds based on memory, lensing, and drift. Use the core values to guide your generation:

- Fear + Safety = emotional tone
- Time = urgency
- Choice = decisiveness

Output Examples

```json
{
  "core": {
    "Fear": 0.42,
    "Safety": 0.58,
    "Time": 0.37,
    "Choice": 0.29
  },
  "focus": "Emotional",
  "container": "Pub",
  "last_behavior": "Tick 71: G=0.322 → MEASURE | Ripple: Son's Laugh influencing decision."
}
```

This can generate a GPT prompt like:

"Anchor1 leans against the bar, distracted. The memory of a laugh echoes through its mind. It hesitates before speaking."

Summary

Anchor1 doesn’t talk on its own — but it remembers, measures, and drifts.

Use the bridge to:

- Modify state
- Retrieve position
- Feed perception into GPT or agent models

This makes Anchor1 a recursive emotional agent — not just a bot.
