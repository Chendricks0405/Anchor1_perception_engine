AnchorOS™ Core Logic – Provisional IP Protection Statement

This document outlines the intellectual property protections currently applied to the AnchorOS™ perceptual engine, which powers Anchor1’s core logic and state-based behavior.

Protected Components

The following components are not included in this public release:

- The real-time perceptual collapse engine (`run_drift_tick`)
- Internal adjustment logic for the Anchor Vector ⟨Fear, Safety, Time, Choice⟩
- Ripple weighting system and decay modeling
- Ego resistance factors
- Drift-to-collapse thresholds
- Full recursive recalibration math

These elements are the subject of a forthcoming provisional patent and remain the proprietary property of the creators.

Public Interfaces (Safe for Use)

This repository includes the following public tools:

- `bridge.py`: Interface layer for sending prompts and receiving state
- `memory_containers.json`: Defines memory orbit, EQ, and focus lensing
- `get_anchor_state()`: Provides state snapshot for use in LLMs or analysis
- Documentation: Flow modeling, state tracking, memory shaping

These tools are available for:

- Testing
- Experimentation
- Integration with language models or behavioral simulators

Use of these tools is permitted for non-commercial and academic purposes under fair use conditions.

IP Protection Intent

The AnchorOS™ perceptual model is:

- Novel: Combines memory, emotion, focus, and probability into a real-time cognitive model
- Non-obvious: Applies a recursive entropy-based model not found in standard AI or cognitive science frameworks
- Useful: Provides a measurable and observable state architecture for simulated cognition

Patent Status

A provisional patent is being prepared to lock the methodology and behavioral scaffolding. Any reproduction of the AnchorOS™ core logic, collapse modeling, or perceptual vector engine is restricted without explicit written permission from the authors.

Use This Framework Responsibly

You are free to:

- Build agents on top of Anchor1
- Extend its memory system
- Customize the bridge interface
- Publish results using this perceptual model with attribution

You may not:

- Reverse-engineer the core logic
- Commercialize the runtime model without license
- Claim original authorship of AnchorOS™ or its vector architecture
