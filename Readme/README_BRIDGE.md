Bridge Layer (bridge.py)

The `bridge.py` module connects Anchor1 (AnchorOS runtime) to any external agent, LLM, or API.

Features:
- Parses user input into measurable perceptual changes
- Applies Anchor Vector deltas (⟨F, S, T, C⟩)
- Triggers relevant memory containers
- Returns Anchor1's state as a JSON object

Use this to:
- Let a CustomGPT or LLM talk to Anchor1
- Use Anchor1's state to inform LLM output
- Simulate ripple-based perception loops

This is where perception becomes programmable.
