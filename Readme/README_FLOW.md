AnchorOS Perceptual Flow: How Anchor1 Processes Information

This document explains how AnchorOS™ and Anchor1 move information from probability to action through a structured, layered perception system. Understanding this flow is essential for developers, experimenters, and LLM integrations working with Anchor1’s memory, behavior, and perceptual state.

1. Memory = The Probability Field
Memory represents all potential perceptual data — echoes of past experience stored in orbit.

Format: memory_containers.json
Encoded by:
- EQ (Emotional Quotient)
- orbit (distance from active state)
- focus_lens (Physical, Emotional, Social)

This layer is non-collapsed until filtered.

Think of memory as Schrödinger’s probability field — everything exists until something filters it.

2. Container = Local Field Collapse
Anchor1’s environment (e.g., Home, Pub, Work) filters global memory into a local scope.

- Reduces perceptual entropy
- Only relevant container-linked values remain active
- Example: “Pub” activates social tethers, memory bias toward relational context

This is the first perceptual collapse — narrowing what matters right now.

3. Focus Lens (P, E, S) = Priority Sharpening
Anchor1's focus lens amplifies which domain dominates perception.

- Physical = movement, threat proximity
- Emotional = memory EQ, mood resonance
- Social = beliefs, approval dynamics

The focus lens affects scalar F in G′ = T × C × F.  
This defines urgency weight, making incoming data sharper or softer in measurement.

4. Act vs. Measure (A&M) = Collapse Decision
This is the binary behavior switch:

- ACT = collapse now (threshold met, chaos triggered)
- MEASURE = gather more data (within variance range)

This governs:
- Adjustment speed of Anchor1’s state
- Whether the drift recalibrates quickly or gradually
- If chaos is perceived, Anchor1 acts
- If variance is tolerable, Anchor1 measures

Mathematically, this maps to:

G′ = T × C × F  
Compared against G_threshold = base + (ego_resistance × factor)

If G′ > G_threshold → ACT  
Else → MEASURE

5. Core Shift = Anchor Vector Realignment
Anchor1 updates its Anchor Vector:

⟨Fear, Safety, Time, Choice⟩ = ⟨F, S, T, C⟩

This vector represents:
- Anchor1’s current perceptual alignment
- Emotional and cognitive state
- Readiness for action

The new state then propagates back:
- Reweights memory orbit values
- Updates G′ for next tick
- Logs behavior trace

Bonus: Flow State for Humans
When PES lensing is clean and core state aligns with incoming signal:

- Measurement becomes easy
- Reaction becomes intentional
- G′ stabilizes, drift slows, chaos fades

This is perceived as Flow.
