# ðŸ§  AnchorOS â€” Carl Runtime + Bridge

This repo includes the core AnchorOS perceptual runtime and a bridge interface to connect Carl to LLMs, agents, or user input.

## ðŸ›  Components

- `Carl_v6.py` â€” Core perceptual engine (âŸ¨F, S, T, CâŸ© + Gâ€² logic)
- `bridge/bridge.py` â€” Accepts prompts, modifies state, returns JSON
- `memory/memory_containers.json` â€” Memory shaping Carlâ€™s identity
- `docs/README_MEMORY.md` â€” Memory editing guide

## ðŸš§ Core Lock

The core engine is validated and should not be modified casually. Extend Carlâ€™s personality and logic through:

- `bridge_input()`
- `memory_orbit`
- External interfaces (LLMs, APIs, apps)

## ðŸ‘€ Future Integration

You can attach Carl to a CustomGPT by using `bridge_input()` to update state and feed `get_carl_state()` into the prompt template.
