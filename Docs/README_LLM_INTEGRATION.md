# 🤖 LLM Integration with Carl — Talking to the Observer

This guide explains how to connect Carl (running on AnchorOS™) to a language model like GPT or any agent-based system.

You’ll use Carl’s **Bridge Layer** to:
- Send user input, events, or system signals
- Trigger memory reactions and anchor shifts
- Retrieve a full internal state snapshot
- Feed that state into an LLM for context-aware response

---

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. User input is sent to `bridge_input(session, "message or event")`
2. Carl’s memory and anchors update
3. A behavior log is written (ACT, MEASURE, or DRIFT)
4. Carl’s current state is returned via `get_carl_state(session)`
5. That state is embedded in the LLM prompt

---

## 🔧 Code Example (Carl x LLM prompt logic)

```python
from bridge.bridge import bridge_input, get_carl_state, load_memory, initialize_carl_memory

session = ...  # a mock or real session object with Carl's state

# Example prompt to Carl
user_input = "Carl, remember the cave and prepare for a fight."

# Send input through bridge
bridge_input(session, user_input)

# Get updated state
state = get_carl_state(session)

# Build prompt for LLM
context_prompt = f'''
Carl is currently in:
- Container: {state["container"]}
- Focus: {state["focus"]}
- Core State: Fear={state["anchor_vector"]["Fear"]}, Safety={state["anchor_vector"]["Safety"]}, Time={state["anchor_vector"]["Time"]}, Choice={state["anchor_vector"]["Choice"]}
- Last behavior: {state["last_behavior"]}

Use this state to generate a realistic, emotionally-aware response as Carl.
'''

# Use `context_prompt` in your OpenAI or LangChain agent
```

## 🔌 Prompt Engineering Tip

Keep prompts **stateful but simple**. Carl isn’t scripted — he responds based on memory, lensing, and drift. Use the core values to guide your generation:

- Fear + Safety = emotional tone
- Time = urgency
- Choice = decisiveness

---

## 📥 Output Examples

```json
{
  "core": {
    "Fear": 0.42,
    "Safety": 0.58,
    "Time": 0.37,
    "Choice": 0.29
  },
  "focus": "Emotional",
  "container": "Pub",
  "last_behavior": "Tick 71: G=0.322 → MEASURE | Ripple: Son's Laugh influencing decision."
}
```

This can generate a GPT prompt like:

> "Carl leans against the bar, distracted. The memory of his son laughing echoes through his mind. He hesitates before speaking."

---

## 📘 Summary

Carl doesn’t *talk* on his own — but he *remembers*, *feels*, and *measures*.

Use the bridge to:
- Modify his state
- Retrieve his position
- Feed that into GPT or agent models

This makes Carl a **recursive emotional agent** — not just a bot.
