### üß† Bridge Layer (bridge.py)

The `bridge.py` module connects Carl (AnchorOS runtime) to any external agent, LLM, or API.

**Features:**
- Parses user input into measurable perceptual changes
- Applies Anchor Vector deltas (‚ü®F, S, T, C‚ü©)
- Triggers relevant memory containers
- Returns Carl's state as a JSON object

Use this to:
- Let a CustomGPT or LLM talk *to* Carl
- Use Carl's state to inform *LLM output*
- Simulate ripple-based perception loops

This is where perception becomes programmable.
