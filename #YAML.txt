- **T** = Time (urgency)
- **C** = Choice/Consequence
- **F** = Focus Lens Amplifier (Physical, Emotional, Social, Multi)

Gâ€² governs Carl's goal pressure and decision logic, feeding a recursive feedback loop that simulates perception collapse, recalibration, or drift.

## ðŸ§  Core Engine Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Anchor Vector    | âŸ¨Fear, Safety, Time, ChoiceâŸ© â€“ The real-time emotional/decision state  
| Focus Lens       | Modulates perception (Physical, Emotional, Social, Multi)  
| Memory Moons     | Weighted experience orbits (EQ) influence behavior when aligned  
| Ego Resistance   | Prevents recalibration if identity is under threat  
| Container Links  | Environment transitions with inertia effects  
| Impact Button    | Simulates Carl's internal recalibration (rebalancing F/S/C)  
| Drift Loop       | Run a cognitive tick to simulate internal state processing
